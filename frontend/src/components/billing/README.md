### `/billing/checkout`

## Navigation Memory

The system implements page-to-page navigation memory:

### How it works:
1. Before navigating away from billing, save current state:
   - Active tab
   - Scroll position
   - Search term
   - Any filters

2. When returning to billing:
   - Restore scroll position
   - Optionally restore active tab and search term

### Usage:
```typescript
import { NavigationMemory } from '@/utils/navigationMemory';

// Save state before navigation
NavigationMemory.saveBillingState(activeTab, window.scrollY, searchTerm);

// Restore state on return
const state = NavigationMemory.getState();
if (state && state.origin === '/billing') {
  NavigationMemory.restoreScrollPosition(state.scrollPosition);
}
```

## Role-Based Access
