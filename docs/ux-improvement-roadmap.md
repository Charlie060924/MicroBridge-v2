1. Brand Color System
Primary Brand Color (Recommendation)
Electric Blue — #006bff

Rationale: Blue is strongly associated with trust, professionalism, and technology—ideal for a platform that’s both “bridge” (MicroBridge!) and digital. It reads well in both English and Chinese contexts and appeals to students, employers, and educational institutions alike. Blue is also the most consistent color across your existing landing and student portal.

Supporting Palette
Secondary (Accent): Teal #20c5a8

Evokes freshness and energy; works for highlights, links, or accent badges. Already familiar in your app.

Success: Green #28c76f

Used exclusively for positive confirmations, approvals, and “hired” status.

Warning: Amber/Yellow #ffba00

For warnings, cautions, and pending statuses.

Error: Red #f44336

For errors, rejections, failed payments.

Info: Light Blue #00b8ff (lighter than primary)

For secondary info messages, tooltips, inactive statuses.

Neutral:

Dark: #181c31 (backgrounds, dark cards)

Light: #edf5ff (background), #fbfbfb (background), #ffffff (white cards)

Grays: #757693, #999aa1, #eeeeee for text and subtle UI.

2. Semantic Color System & Application
Semantic Role	Color	Usage Example
Primary	#006bff	All main actions, CTA, links, icons
Secondary	#20c5a8	Accents, links, secondary actions
Success	#28c76f	Success states, hired, approved
Warning	#ffba00	Warnings, “pending” states
Error	#f44336	Errors, rejected, failed payments
Info	#00b8ff	Hints, tooltips, neutral info
Background	#edf5ff/#fbfbfb/#181c31	Light backgrounds / dark sections
Guidelines:

Statuses: Always use green for “approved/success”, yellow for “pending/warning”, red for errors/rejections, blue ONLY for info—not as a substitute for “success”.

Portals: Stick to the blue primary for both student and employer portals for unified brand, but introduce subtle role-specific accent colors via secondary (teal for student, gold for employer), NOT for main actions or status logic.

Buttons: Primary actions in all portals = blue, Secondary = teal, Success = green. Never swap colors.

3. Typography, Spacing, Components
Typography
Adopt a geometric sans-serif font (e.g. Inter, Manrope, or Noto Sans) for modern, highly readable feel and multilingual compatibility.

Font weights: 400 (regular), 600 (semibold), 700 (bold).

Scale:

h1: 2.25rem/700

h2: 1.5rem/700

h3: 1.25rem/600

body: 1rem/400

caption: 0.87rem/400

Spacing & Layout
“8px grid” for paddings, margins, border-radius (4–8px standard).

Card component: 2xl:px-8 py-6, rounded-lg, subtle box-shadow (#181c31/10%).

Headings: Always use clear hierarchy and spacing (mb-2, mb-4).

Component Styling
Buttons: Height 44px min, icon support, rounded-lg, blue-gradient on hover for primaries.

Inputs: 48px height, clear labels, strong focus ring (blue).

Tabs: Underline/indicator using primary blue.

Pills/badges: Use accent or semantic color backgrounds and white text, rounded-full, clear size hierarchy.

4. Accessibility
Contrast: Ensure all text-background pairs meet at least WCAG AA (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large). Primary blue and white easily pass; teal/amber backgrounds with white or black text should be tested for contrast.

Focus States: All interactive elements must have clear, visible focus states (outline-2, focus:ring-primary).

Legible font sizes: Never set body copy below 16px. Caption can go to 14px, never lower.

Alt Text: Every icon and logo must have descriptive alt.

5. Cohesive Cross-Portal Alignment
Global Consistency: All portals share main navigation bar style, card design, button appearance, and status badge system—with only role-indicating accent color (sidebar or highlights) to subtly differentiate.

Role-Specific Accent:

Student Portal: Use teal (#20c5a8) for profile highlights, dashboard cards, and info.

Employer Portal: Use gold/yellow (#ffba00) for highlights—not for actions or main backgrounds.

Unified Landing Page: Showcase both blue and accent (teal/yellow) for sections targeting students and employers; never use green as the main identity.

1. Landing Page (/)
Sections Included:

Hero, Brands, Features, FeaturesTab, Testimonials, Pricing, FAQ, Contact, Footer

Gaps or Redundancies:

“Brands” and “Testimonials” rely on mock data without real trust signals from actual users/clients.

No obvious trust badges (security, verified payments, etc.) or “How It Works” step-by-step section.

Feature and CTA separation by role is good, but messaging may become fragmented if not unified by overall value prop.

Recommendations:

Add a “How MicroBridge Works” section before Features, with a 3–5 step visual for both hiring and job-seeking journeys.

Dedicate a trust signals strip (media features, security badges, payment protection messaging) after Testimonials.

Consider merging Brands and Testimonials into one scrollytelling “Success Stories” section once real cases come in.

Unify CTA tone — both students and employers should encounter clear, repeated next steps (sign up, post a job, explore jobs).

Reinforce message alignment: ensure features, testimonials, and portal experiences use consistent terminology.

2. Student Portal
Dashboard
Sections: PreviewBanner, Welcome Header, SearchBar, Recently Viewed, Featured Jobs, Current Projects, Stats Cards
Gaps:

No onboarding guide/walkthrough for new users.

No progress/status bar for profile/job readiness.
Recommendations:

Add a “Get Started” or onboarding checklist for new users (profile strength, recommended actions).

Include a persistent “profile completeness” indicator.

Highlight action CTAs (e.g., “Complete profile,” “Apply to a project”).

Profile
Sections: Personal Info, Education, Skills, Goals, Availability, Compensation, Portfolio, Reviews, Level System
Gaps:

Skills/goals entry might lack guided help or suggestions.

Level system not visually tied to real outcomes (badges, career milestones).
Recommendations:

Use suggestive input/autocomplete for skills and goals.

Visually celebrate milestones/XP gains.

Highlight completed micro-internships in an achievement timeline.

Applications
Sections: Application List, Status Tracking, Empty State
Gaps:

If empty, only an unhelpful empty state.
Recommendation:

Add recommended jobs prompt in empty state.

Make status tracking color/semantic mapping consistent with design system.

Jobs
Sections: Hero, Filters Sidebar, Jobs List
Gaps:

No “saved jobs”/starred section.

Potential for overload without grouping jobs (by field, deadline, recency).
Recommendations:

Add a “Saved Jobs” and “Recommended for You” tab.

Group open roles (e.g., by category or deadline) for scannability.

Job Details
Sections: Job details displayed
Gaps:

No “trust signals” (verified, reviewed, employer rating).

Lacks CTA prominence.
Recommendations:

Show “verified employer” badge when available.

Highlight apply CTA and similar jobs at the bottom.

Calendar, Settings, Notifications
Gaps:

Calendar could integrate deadlines/interview dates visually.

Settings page should have descriptive section labels and consistent controls.
Recommendations:

Ensure notification and calendar UX matches portal design (color, icons, spacing).

3. Employer Portal
Dashboard
Sections: PreviewBanner, Welcome, Stats Cards, Recent Postings, Job Performance, Recommended Candidates
Gaps:

No onboarding/checklist for new employers.

No quick link to “Post Your First Job” if none posted yet.
Recommendations:

Add an onboarding “wizard” or action guide for first-time employers.

Display best-practices tips (how to write effective postings, response rate improvements).

Post Job
Sections: Posting form
Gaps:

No template/sample posting guidance.
Recommendation:

Offer job post templates or autofill from previous postings.

Manage Jobs, Candidates, Applications
Gaps:

If no activity, could be empty/unhelpful.

Status and filtering can become inconsistent or cluttered.
Recommendations:

Smart empty states (“No jobs yet, try posting now!”).

Consistency in card designs, tabs, and status coloring.

Candidate Details
Gaps:

Lacks “next action” CTAs (message, shortlist, rate, etc.).

Should highlight candidate trust signals (level, verification, reviews).
Recommendation:

Add next actionable CTA sticky bar.

Show timeline of prior applications/interactions if available.

Company Info, Reports
Gaps:

Reports may be too basic or static.
Recommendations:

Add “insights” or beta analytics and benchmarks (conversion rates, average applicant quality, etc.).

Calendar, Interviews, Settings, Pricing
Recommendations:

Integrate with Google/Outlook for scheduling.

Make subscription status and billing access clear in Settings/Pricing.

4. Shared Pages
Billing, Authentication, Marketing (FAQs, Docs, Blog)
Gaps:

Authentication could offer social or university SSO for smoother onboarding.

Blog, FAQ, Docs may have inconsistent tone/branding.
Recommendations:

Standardize authentication flows (button placement, messages).

Use a shared content style guide for all long-form/support content.

Group Marketing pages under a clear “Resources” section.

5. Consistency Checklist
Section & Button Naming: Use identical verbage (“Dashboard,” “Profile,” “Settings”) for both student and employer, avoid “My/Your” toggling.

Layout: Maintain unified card/list/table designs, similar section ordering across both portals.

Status Colors: Map to semantic palette everywhere: green=success, yellow=warning, blue=info, red=error.

Navigation: Navigation bars and sidebar layouts follow the same structure, only swap out role-specific accent colors.

Content Patterns: Onboarding checklists, profile strength/progress, trust badges, and action CTAs are found in both portals, slightly adapted by audience.

Headline & Taglines: Align landing CTAs/headlines with what users see immediately after login (reinforce the same value prop).
