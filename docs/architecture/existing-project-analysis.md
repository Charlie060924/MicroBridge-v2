# Existing Project Analysis

### Current Project State
- **Primary Purpose:** Bilingual micro-internship platform connecting Hong Kong university students with startups through paid project-based work
- **Current Tech Stack:** Go 1.21 backend with Gin framework, Next.js 15.1.6 frontend with React 19, PostgreSQL 15, Redis 7, full Docker containerization
- **Architecture Style:** Microservices-ready monolith with sophisticated matching algorithms, layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Deployment Method:** Production-ready Docker Compose with comprehensive monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack), nginx reverse proxy, automated backups

### Available Documentation
- Advanced matching algorithm with bidirectional scoring (`MatchScore`, `SkillGap` analysis)
- Comprehensive Redis caching layer with matching optimization
- Production-ready infrastructure with monitoring, logging, and backup systems
- Sophisticated middleware stack (auth, rate limiting, CORS, enhanced security)
- Component library with virtualization for performance (`VirtualizedCandidateList`)
- Dark mode theming system currently implemented (targeted for removal)

### Identified Constraints
- Existing sophisticated matching algorithm must be preserved and enhanced, not replaced
- Production Redis infrastructure with specific caching patterns must be maintained
- Current Go 1.21/PostgreSQL/GORM patterns and conventions must be followed
- Existing JWT authentication, rate limiting, and security middleware must remain intact
- Current Docker containerization approach with 3-tier architecture must be preserved
- Performance requirements: <3 second page loads, 99.5% uptime, existing monitoring must continue functioning
