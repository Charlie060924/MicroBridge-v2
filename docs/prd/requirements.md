# Requirements

### Functional

**FR1**: The existing MicroBridge matching algorithm shall integrate AI-powered machine learning recommendations while maintaining current multi-factor scoring system (skills, experience, location, availability) without breaking existing functionality.

**FR2**: The platform shall implement predictive matching capabilities that learn from successful project completions, user feedback, and behavioral patterns to improve future recommendations by 40%+ accuracy.

**FR3**: The enhanced matching system shall provide real-time match score explanations and personalized improvement suggestions to both students and employers through existing dashboard interfaces.

**FR4**: The AI matching system shall integrate with existing Redis caching infrastructure to provide sub-3-second response times for match calculations and recommendations.

**FR5**: The platform shall implement advanced performance optimizations building upon existing virtualization (VirtualizedCandidateList) to support 10x current user load without degradation.

**FR6**: The existing React component library shall be enhanced with a standardized design system maintaining current functionality while improving visual consistency and user experience, with dark mode removed for simplified maintenance and improved performance.

**FR11**: The platform shall remove existing dark/light theme complexity to reduce bundle size, eliminate theme-related performance overhead, and simplify component maintenance by focusing on a single optimized light theme.

**FR7**: The platform shall implement progressive loading and optimization techniques for all existing dashboards (student portal, employer portal) while preserving current feature functionality.

**FR8**: The AI system shall provide batch processing capabilities for existing large datasets (users, jobs, applications) without interrupting current platform operations.

**FR9**: The enhanced UI shall maintain existing accessibility features while implementing improved responsive design and mobile optimization across all current pages.

**FR10**: The system shall implement A/B testing framework for AI recommendations and UI changes using existing user segmentation and analytics infrastructure.

### Non Functional

**NFR1**: Enhancement must maintain existing performance characteristics and not exceed current memory usage by more than 30% during peak load scenarios.

**NFR2**: AI matching calculations must complete within existing 5-second timeout constraints while processing current data volumes (users, jobs, applications).

**NFR3**: The enhanced system shall maintain 99.5% uptime compatibility with existing Prometheus monitoring and alerting infrastructure.

**NFR4**: All AI models shall be deployable within existing Docker containerization framework without requiring additional infrastructure components.

**NFR5**: The UI/UX overhaul shall maintain current page load performance budgets (<3 seconds) while improving visual quality and user engagement metrics.

**NFR6**: Enhanced matching system shall support existing concurrent user loads (100+ simultaneous users) with improved response times through caching optimization.

**NFR7**: AI training and inference processes shall operate within existing PostgreSQL and Redis resource constraints without impacting current transaction processing.

**NFR8**: The design system implementation shall maintain existing bundle size limits while adding new component capabilities and visual improvements.

**NFR9**: All enhancements shall maintain compatibility with current browser support requirements (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge latest 2 versions).

**NFR10**: The enhanced platform shall support existing security requirements (JWT authentication, rate limiting, input validation) while adding AI-specific security measures.

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: **Existing API Compatibility** - All current REST API endpoints must remain functional with existing request/response formats while adding optional AI enhancement parameters

**CR2**: **Database Schema Compatibility** - New AI features must integrate with existing PostgreSQL schema (users, jobs, applications, reviews) through additional tables and relationships without altering current data structures

**CR3**: **UI/UX Consistency** - Enhanced design system must preserve existing user workflows and navigation patterns while improving visual design and component reusability

**CR4**: **Integration Compatibility** - AI matching enhancements must work seamlessly with existing Stripe payments, calendar integration, review system, and gamification features without disrupting current functionality
