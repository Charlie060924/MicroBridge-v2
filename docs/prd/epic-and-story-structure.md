# Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic with rationale

**Rationale for Single Epic Approach:**
Based on analysis of MicroBridge's existing architecture, this enhancement requires a single, coordinated epic because:

- **Shared Infrastructure Dependencies**: AI matching improvements require performance optimizations to handle ML inference loads, and UI enhancements need to display AI insights effectively
- **Interconnected User Experience**: Enhanced matching algorithms drive new UI components for match explanations, which require performance optimizations for real-time updates
- **Common Technical Foundation**: All three areas leverage existing Go/React architecture, PostgreSQL data, and Redis caching infrastructure
- **Coordinated Testing Requirements**: AI accuracy, performance improvements, and UI changes must be validated together through integrated user testing and A/B experiments
- **Simplified Architecture**: Removing dark mode complexity creates unified technical approach across all enhancement areas

**This story sequence is designed to minimize risk to your existing system. Does this order make sense given your project's architecture and constraints?**
