# Story 2.1: Advanced Matching Features

**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: Important  
**Estimated Effort**: 5-6 days  
**Dependencies**: 1.3 Basic Matching Algorithm

## Objective
Enhance the basic matching algorithm with advanced features including bidirectional matching, skill gap analysis, learning recommendations, and AI-powered matching insights.

## Current State
- ✅ Basic matching algorithm working (after 1.3)
- ❌ Only simple skill matching implemented
- ❌ No bidirectional scoring (employer→student, student→job)
- ❌ Missing skill gap analysis and recommendations
- ❌ No AI-powered insights or learning recommendations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Bidirectional matching scores (student fits job AND job fits student)
- [ ] Skill gap analysis with learning recommendations
- [ ] Career growth path suggestions
- [ ] Match quality insights and explanations
- [ ] Historical matching performance analytics
- [ ] Personalized matching preferences
- [ ] Industry trend integration

- [ ] Handle mutual interest indicators

### Task 2: Skill Gap Analysis
- [ ] Compare user skills vs job requirements
- [ ] Identify missing skills and competency gaps
- [ ] Suggest skill development paths
- [ ] Recommend courses or certifications
- [ ] Track skill acquisition over time

### Task 3: AI-Enhanced Matching Insights
- [ ] Analyze matching patterns and success rates
- [ ] Generate personalized matching explanations
- [ ] Predict matching success probability
- [ ] Identify optimal career paths
- [ ] Surface industry trends and opportunities

### Task 4: Advanced Matching Preferences  
- [ ] User-defined matching preferences
- [ ] Company culture fit scoring
- [ ] Work style compatibility
- [ ] Career goal alignment
- [ ] Compensation expectation matching

### Task 5: Matching Analytics and Reporting
- [ ] User matching performance dashboard
- [ ] Employer matching success analytics
- [ ] Platform-wide matching metrics
- [ ] A/B testing for algorithm improvements
- [ ] ROI tracking for matching effectiveness

## Advanced Algorithm Logic
```
Enhanced Matching Pipeline:
1. Basic Compatibility (from 1.3)
2. Bidirectional Scoring:
   - Student interest in job role/company
   - Employer preference for student profile
   - Mutual benefit analysis
3. Skill Gap Analysis:
   - Required vs available skills mapping
   - Competency level assessment
   - Learning path generation
4. Cultural & Personal Fit:
   - Work style preferences
   - Company culture alignment
   - Career goal compatibility
5. Success Prediction:
   - Historical data analysis
   - Pattern recognition
   - Probability scoring
