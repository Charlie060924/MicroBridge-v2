## AI-Enhanced Algorithm Logic Overview
```
1. Hybrid Matching Pipeline:
   - Basic compatibility scoring (existing algorithm)
   - AI enhancement layer with confidence scoring
   - Behavioral pattern analysis integration
   - Fallback to basic algorithm if AI unavailable

2. Machine Learning Components:
   - User preference learning from interaction history
   - Job success prediction from historical match outcomes
   - Collaborative filtering for similar user patterns
   - Skill gap analysis with learning recommendations

3. AI-Enhanced Score Calculation:
   - Traditional factors (skills, experience, location, availability)
   - AI confidence score and success probability
   - Personalization based on user behavior patterns
   - Dynamic weighting based on individual user preferences

4. Intelligent Explanations:
   - Match reasoning with specific skill alignments
   - Skill gap identification and improvement suggestions
   - Career growth path recommendations
   - Success probability with confidence intervals

5. Continuous Learning:
   - User feedback integration for model improvement
   - Real-time behavioral pattern updates
   - Automatic model retraining on successful matches
   - A/B testing for algorithm optimization
