   - Project success prediction from historical AI match data

3. LLM Explanation Layer (Premium Features):
   - Match reasoning: "Why this job fits your profile..."
   - Skill gap analysis: "Consider adding TypeScript to qualify..."
   - Career guidance: "Your next step toward senior developer..."
   - Cached responses for cost optimization (80%+ hit rate)

4. Business Intelligence Integration:
   - Usage tracking for both AI matching and LLM explanations
   - Subscription tier enforcement (Free: 10 explanations/month)
   - Cost monitoring with automatic throttling
   - A/B testing for conversion optimization

5. Continuous Learning Pipeline:

    BasicScore      float64                 `json:"basic_score"`
    AIScore         float64                 `json:"ai_score"`
    ConfidenceLevel float64                 `json:"confidence_level"`
    SuccessProbability float64             `json:"success_probability"`
    // LLM explanations generated separately for cost control
}

// AI Matching System Interface
type AIMatchingSystem interface {
    FindMatches(userID string) ([]AIMatchResult, error)
    TrainFromFeedback(matchID string, outcome MatchOutcome) error
    GetMatchConfidence(userProfile UserProfile, jobProfile JobProfile) (float64, error)
}

// LLM Explanation Service (Separate System)
type LLMExplanationService interface {
    ExplainMatch(match AIMatchResult) (string, error)        // Cached, cost-monitored
    AnalyzeSkillGaps(userID string, jobID string) (string, error)  // Pro tier only
    GenerateCareerAdvice(userID string) (string, error)     // Pro tier only
}

// Hybrid Architecture Implementation
type SmartMatchingService struct {
    aiMatcher       AIMatchingSystem
    basicMatcher    BasicMatchingAlgorithm
    llmService     LLMExplanationService
    usageTracker   UsageTracker
    fallbackMode   bool
