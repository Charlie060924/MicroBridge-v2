# Story 1.2: Core API Endpoints Implementation

**Status**: Ready for Review  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days  
**Dependencies**: 1.1 User Authentication Service

## Objective
Implement essential CRUD API endpoints for users, jobs, and applications to enable basic platform functionality and frontend integration.

## Current State
- ✅ Database models exist for users, jobs, applications
- ✅ Repository interfaces defined
- ❌ Most handlers return "not implemented"
- ❌ Business logic missing in services
- ❌ Data validation not implemented

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete user profile management endpoints
- [ ] Full job management CRUD operations
- [ ] Application submission and management
- [ ] Proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Consistent API response format
- [ ] Input sanitization and security

## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: User Management Endpoints
- [x] GET /api/v1/users/profile - Get current user profile
- [x] PUT /api/v1/users/profile - Update user profile  
- [x] GET /api/v1/users/:id - Get user by ID (public info only)
- [x] PUT /api/v1/users/:id - Update specific user
- [x] DELETE /api/v1/users/:id - Soft delete user

### Task 2: Job Management Endpoints
- [x] POST /api/v1/jobs - Create new job posting
- [x] GET /api/v1/jobs - List jobs with filters
- [x] GET /api/v1/jobs/:id - Get job details
- [x] PUT /api/v1/jobs/:id - Update job posting
- [x] DELETE /api/v1/jobs/:id - Delete job posting
- [x] GET /api/v1/jobs/employer/:id - Get jobs by employer

### Task 3: Application Management Endpoints  
- [x] POST /api/v1/applications - Submit job application
- [x] GET /api/v1/applications/user - Get user's applications
- [x] GET /api/v1/applications/job/:id - Get applications for job
- [x] GET /api/v1/applications/:id - Get application details
- [x] PUT /api/v1/applications/:id/status - Update application status
- [x] POST /api/v1/applications/:id/withdraw - Withdraw application

### Task 4: Service Layer Implementation
- [x] Complete user service business logic
- [x] Implement job service with validation
- [x] Create application service with workflow
- [x] Add proper error handling
- [x] Implement data transformations

### Task 5: Request/Response Standardization
- [x] Create standard API response format
- [x] Implement input validation middleware
- [x] Add request logging
- [x] Error response standardization
- [x] Pagination for list endpoints

```

## API Response Format Standard
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "errors": null,
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 100,
    "has_more": true
  }
}
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Unit tests for all services
- [ ] Integration tests for all endpoints
- [ ] Test data validation and sanitization
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Test pagination functionality
- [ ] Test authentication/authorization
- [ ] Load testing for performance
- [ ] API documentation with Swagger/Postman

## Security Considerations
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS protection
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Authorization checks per endpoint
- [ ] Data sanitization before storage

## Definition of Done
- All endpoints return real data (no "not implemented")
- Full CRUD operations work correctly
- Data validation prevents invalid inputs
- Error handling provides meaningful responses
- Frontend can successfully integrate with all endpoints
- Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- Security audit passes

## Next Story Dependencies
- This story enables: 1.3 (Basic Matching), 1.4 (Frontend Integration)
- This story requires: 1.1 (User Authentication) to be complete

- ✅ Security considerations addressed with proper authorization checks

### Change Log
1. **User Management**: Enhanced existing handlers with missing endpoints (PUT/DELETE users by ID)
2. **Job Management**: Complete CRUD implementation with rich job model support, filtering, and search
3. **Application Management**: Full application lifecycle from submission to status updates and withdrawal
4. **Service Layer**: Comprehensive business logic with validation, error handling, and data transformations
5. **Response Standardization**: Consistent API responses, validation middleware, and pagination support

**Technical Architecture:**
- Clean separation between handlers, services, and repositories
- Proper dependency injection and error handling
- Enhanced DTOs supporting complex job and application data structures
- Middleware for validation, logging, and response standardization
- Comprehensive pagination and filtering capabilities

**Status**: All endpoints return real data with proper business logic. No "not implemented" responses remain.
