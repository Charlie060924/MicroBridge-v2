# Story 1.1: Preview Mode Engaging Demo Content

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** potential student/employer user browsing in preview mode,  
**I want** to see compelling demo content instead of "—" placeholders,  
**so that** I can understand the platform's value before signing up.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Replace all "—" values with realistic demo data across student and employer portals
2. Show sample projects, earnings, and progress in preview mode  
3. Include testimonial quotes in relevant dashboard sections
4. Display "Sign Up to Unlock Your Dashboard" CTAs prominently
5. A/B test framework implemented for demo content effectiveness

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Information
- **PreviewModeContext:** `/src/context/PreviewModeContext.tsx` - Currently manages locked features list
- **Portal Components:** `/src/app/student_portal/workspace/page.tsx` and `/src/app/employer_portal/workspace/page.tsx`
- **Mock Data Service:** Create new `/src/services/demoData.ts`
- **UI Components:** Existing Button and EmptyState components in `/src/components/ui/`

### Key Implementation Details
- Current preview system uses `isFeatureLocked()` function - replace with demo data provider
- Existing mock data in `/src/services/mockData.ts` can be enhanced for preview use
- PreviewBanner component already exists but needs CTA enhancement
- Dashboard components currently show "—" when `isPreviewMode` is true

### Component Dependencies
- Leverage existing `mockCandidates.ts` and expand for comprehensive demo data
- Integrate with existing theme system (dark/light mode support)
- Use established Tailwind CSS patterns from existing components
- Follow existing animation patterns using Framer Motion

### State Management
- Demo data should not persist in localStorage/sessionStorage
- Use React Context for demo data distribution
- Maintain separation between real user data and demo data
- Clear demo data when exiting preview mode

### Testing
- **Test Files Location:** `/src/__tests__/` or co-located with components
- **Testing Framework:** Jest + React Testing Library (existing pattern)
- **Test Requirements:**
  - Unit tests for PreviewDemoData service
  - Integration tests for preview mode switching
  - Component tests for demo content display
  - A/B test analytics validation
- **Performance Testing:** Bundle size impact assessment
- **User Testing:** Preview mode user flow validation

### Success Metrics
- Preview-to-signup conversion rate increase by 40%
- Preview mode bounce rate reduction by 25% 
- Time spent in preview mode increase by 50%
- User feedback score >4.2/5 on "understanding platform value"
