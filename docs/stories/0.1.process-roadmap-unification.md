# Story 0.1: Process Roadmap Unification - Brownfield Addition

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** marketing website visitor (both students and employers),
**I want** to see a unified roadmap component that shows step-by-step process flows specific to my user type,
**so that** I can quickly understand how the MicroBridge platform works for my specific needs.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Marketing home page components (HowItWorks, FeaturesTab)
- Technology: Next.js 15.1.6, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- Follows pattern: Component-based architecture with separate data files and user type differentiation
- Touch points: Home page layout, existing type definitions (FeatureTab), animation patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Create a unified ProcessRoadmap component that combines HowItWorks and FeaturesTab functionality
2. Display separate roadmaps for student and employer user types with clear differentiation
3. Implement step-by-step process visualization showing platform workflow for each user type

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing home page layout and navigation continues to work unchanged
5. New component follows existing design system and animation patterns from HowItWorks
6. Integration with marketing home page maintains current responsive behavior

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Component is covered by appropriate tests following existing test patterns
8. Documentation is updated if needed for component usage
9. No regression in existing home page functionality verified

## Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** Replace individual HowItWorks and FeaturesTab usage with new ProcessRoadmap component
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow HowItWorks component structure with Framer Motion animations and responsive grid layout
- **Key Constraints:** Must support both student and employer roadmaps with clear visual separation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing home page functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Dev Notes

**Relevant Source Tree Info:**
- `/frontend/src/components/marketing/HowItWorks/index.tsx` - Existing component with 5-step process, animations, and responsive design
- `/frontend/src/components/marketing/home/FeaturesTab.tsx` - Component to be merged (currently minimal)
- `/frontend/src/components/marketing/home/FeaturesTab/featuresTabData.tsx` - Contains student/employer specific content structure
- `/frontend/src/types/featureTab.ts` - Type definitions for feature tab data structure

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- HowItWorks component has established patterns for: Framer Motion animations, responsive grid layouts, user type badges, step numbering, and CTA sections
- FeaturesTab data structure separates student and employer content with descriptive titles, descriptions, and images
- Component should combine the process flow visualization of HowItWorks with the user type separation of FeaturesTab
- Existing design tokens: `bg-neutral-light`, `text-waterloo`, `btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`

**Animation Patterns:**
- Container stagger animations with `containerVariants` and `itemVariants`
- `whileInView` triggers with `viewport={{ once: true }}`
- Consistent transition durations (0.6s) and easing (`easeOut`)

### Testing
**Test file location:** `/frontend/src/components/marketing/__tests__/ProcessRoadmap.test.tsx`

**Test standards:**
- Follow existing test patterns in marketing components
- Test both student and employer roadmap rendering
- Test user type switching functionality
- Test responsive behavior
- Test animation triggers

**Testing frameworks and patterns:**
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Jest for test runner
- Test user interactions and state changes
- Snapshot testing for visual regression
