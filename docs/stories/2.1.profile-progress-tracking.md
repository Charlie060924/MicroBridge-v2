# Story 2.1: Profile Completeness Indicator & Progress Tracking

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user building my profile on MicroBridge,  
**I want** to see my completion progress and understand what's missing,  
**so that** I'm motivated to complete all sections for better job matching.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement circular progress indicator (0-100%) visible in profile header and dashboard
2. Show specific sections needed for completion with clear action items
3. Display benefits of each completion milestone ("Complete education for 2x more matches")
4. Add celebration animations for reaching major milestones (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
5. Include comparison to other users ("You're ahead of 78% of users")
6. Provide one-click navigation to incomplete profile sections
7. Show XP points earned for profile completion actions
8. Track profile strength score with detailed breakdown
9. Display "Profile Boost Tips" with personalized recommendations

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Information
- **Profile Components:** `/src/app/student_portal/workspace/profile/` - Main profile implementation
- **Profile Sections:** Multiple components like `EducationSection.tsx`, `SkillsAndGoals.tsx`, etc.
- **Settings Pages:** `/src/app/student_portal/workspace/settings/` - Profile completion integration
- **Level System:** `/src/components/common/Level/` - Existing XP and achievement system
- **User Hooks:** `/src/hooks/useUser.ts` - User data management

### Key Implementation Details
- Existing profile structure has sections: Personal, Education, Skills, Portfolio, Availability, etc.
- Level system already exists with XP points - can be integrated for profile completion rewards
- Profile editing is handled through modals and dedicated pages
- User data structure in `/src/types/` defines profile schema
- Achievement system exists in Level components - can be extended

### Component Integration Points
- Dashboard components already display user stats - add profile completion
- Existing ProfilePreview component can show completion status
- Level system components (LevelProgressBar, AchievementList) can be enhanced
- Settings components have section-based navigation - perfect for completion tracking
- User profile forms already track changes - add completion validation

### Data Schema Enhancements
```typescript
interface ProfileCompleteness {
  overall: number; // 0-100
  sections: {
    personal: { completed: boolean; weight: number; score: number };
    education: { completed: boolean; weight: number; score: number };
    skills: { completed: boolean; weight: number; score: number };
    portfolio: { completed: boolean; weight: number; score: number };
    availability: { completed: boolean; weight: number; score: number };
    preferences: { completed: boolean; weight: number; score: number };
  };
  nextActions: CompletionAction[];
  strengthScore: number; // Quality of completed sections
  milestones: Milestone[];
  peerRanking: number; // Percentile vs other users
}
```

### State Management
- Integrate with existing user context and profile state
- Use React Query for profile data caching and updates
- Track completion progress in localStorage for offline access
- Sync completion events with level/achievement system

### Performance Considerations
- Debounce completion calculations on profile updates
- Cache peer ranking calculations
- Optimize celebration animations for mobile devices
- Lazy load milestone achievement data

### Testing
- **Test Files Location:** `/src/app/student_portal/workspace/profile/__tests__/`
- **Testing Framework:** Jest + React Testing Library
- **Test Requirements:**
  - Unit tests for completeness calculation algorithms
  - Component tests for progress indicators
  - Integration tests for milestone celebrations
  - User interaction tests for navigation to incomplete sections
  - Performance tests for real-time progress updates
- **Visual Testing:** Storybook stories for progress states

### Analytics & Tracking
- Track profile completion funnel analytics
- Monitor milestone celebration engagement
- A/B test different progress visualization styles
- Track correlation between completion % and job application success

### Success Metrics
- Profile completion rate: 45% â†’ 75% target
- Time to complete profile: -40% reduction
- Profile section engagement: +60% increase
- User retention after hitting 50% completion: +45%
- Job application success rate correlation with completion %
