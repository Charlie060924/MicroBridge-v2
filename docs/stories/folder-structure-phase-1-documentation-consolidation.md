# Folder Structure Phase 1: Documentation Consolidation

## User Story

As a **developer working on MicroBridge**,  
I want **all documentation organized in a centralized, logical folder structure**,  
So that **I can easily find project documentation and maintain consistency across the codebase**.

## Story Context

**Architecture Reference**: `/docs/architecture/proposed-folder-structure-optimization.md` - Phase 1 Implementation  
**Story Type**: Architecture Implementation  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Risk Level**: ✅ **LOW** - Only affects documentation, no code impact

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Current scattered documentation across project root and subdirectories
- Technology: File system organization, documentation maintenance
- Follows pattern: Logical grouping by documentation type and purpose
- Touch points: All documentation files, developer workflow, project maintenance

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Create new `/docs/` structure with architecture/, features/, guides/, and business/ subdirectories
2. Move and consolidate all scattered documentation into logical groupings
3. Merge multiple related documentation files into consolidated guides where appropriate
4. Update any internal documentation references to reflect new file paths
5. Remove redundant or outdated documentation files
6. Ensure all documentation maintains readable format and current information

**Quality Requirements:**
7. No documentation content is lost during the reorganization process
8. All moved files retain git history where possible using `git mv`
9. Documentation structure follows the proposed folder organization exactly
10. Consolidated files maintain clear section breaks between merged content

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** File system reorganization using git mv to preserve history, content consolidation for related docs
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow proposed structure in `proposed-folder-structure-optimization.md`  
- **Key Constraints:** Must preserve all documentation content, maintain readability, avoid breaking any existing references

  - [x] Move PREVIEW_MODE_IMPLEMENTATION.md to docs/features/preview-mode.md
  - [x] Move MOCK_ACCOUNTS_GUIDE.md to docs/business/mock-accounts.md
  - [x] Move Summary.txt to docs/business/project-summary.md
- [x] Consolidate frontend scattered documentation
  - [x] Merge frontend/PERFORMANCE_*.md files into docs/guides/performance-optimization.md
  - [x] Merge frontend/BUTTON_*.md files into docs/guides/ui-testing.md
  - [x] Move other frontend docs to appropriate locations
- [x] Update any internal references to moved documentation files
- [x] Create README.md in main docs/ directory with navigation guide
