# AI Infrastructure Foundation

## User Story

As a **platform administrator**,  
I want **AI service infrastructure integrated with existing backend architecture**,  
So that **machine learning capabilities can be added without impacting current system performance or reliability**.

## Story Context

**Architecture Reference**: `/docs/prd/epic-1-ai-powered-platform-enhancement.md` - Story 1.1 Implementation  
**Story Type**: Infrastructure Implementation  
**Priority**: High  
**Risk Level**: ðŸ”´ **HIGH** - New infrastructure components, database schema changes, potential performance impact, ML dependencies

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Go 1.21 backend architecture, PostgreSQL database, Redis caching, Docker containerization
- Technology: Gin framework, GORM ORM, Prometheus monitoring, existing middleware stack
- Follows pattern: Existing service structure in `/backend/internal/core/`
- Touch points: Database schema, API endpoints, monitoring systems, deployment pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. AI service module created in `/backend/internal/ai/` following existing Go patterns and conventions
2. New database tables (ml_models, prediction_cache, user_behavior_tracking) added via existing GORM migration system
3. AI service endpoints integrated with existing Gin middleware (authentication, rate limiting, CORS)
4. AI infrastructure deployable within current Docker containerization framework
5. Prometheus monitoring extended with AI-specific metrics following existing patterns
6. AI services configurable through existing environment variable and secrets management systems

**Quality Requirements:**
7. All existing API endpoints continue to function with response times within 5ms of baseline
8. Current database performance maintained with new AI tables showing <5ms impact on existing queries
9. Existing monitoring and alerting systems continue to function with addition of AI metrics
10. AI services gracefully degrade to existing matching functionality within 1 second if components fail
11. AI inference operations complete within 3-second timeout or fallback gracefully
12. AI service memory usage stays within 512MB allocation limit
13. Docker image size increase stays under 200MB with AI dependencies

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing backend architecture with AI services module, maintain compatibility with current patterns
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow service patterns in `/backend/internal/core/matching/`  
- **Key Constraints:** Must not impact existing performance, maintain current Docker deployment, preserve all existing functionality

## Risk Mitigation Requirements

**Critical Mitigations:**
1. **Docker Image Size Limit**: AI dependencies must not increase image size >200MB
2. **Database Performance**: New tables must not impact existing query performance >5ms
3. **Graceful Degradation**: AI failures must fallback to existing matching within 1 second
4. **Memory Constraints**: AI inference must not exceed 512MB RAM allocation
5. **Rate Limiting**: AI endpoints need inference-aware rate limiting (10 requests/min per user)
