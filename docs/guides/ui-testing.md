**Fix Implemented**:

- **Modal Integration**: Added `ConfirmationModal` for application confirmation
- **API Integration**: Implemented proper API call to `/applications` endpoint
- **State Management**: Added modal states and loading states
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with user feedback

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Added imports
import JobActionModal, { ModalType } from "@/components/common/JobActionModal";
import ConfirmationModal from "@/components/common/ConfirmationModal";
import { showNotification } from "@/utils/notificationUtils";
import { api } from "@/services/api";

// Added state management
const [showApplyConfirmation, setShowApplyConfirmation] = useState(false);
const [showJobActionModal, setShowJobActionModal] = useState(false);
const [selectedJob, setSelectedJob] = useState<Job | null>(null);
const [isApplying, setIsApplying] = useState(false);

// Implemented API call
const response = await api.post(`/applications`, {
  jobId: selectedJob.id,
  status: 'pending'
});
```

### 2. Employer Portal - Save Job Edit Button

**Location**: `frontend/src/app/jobs/edit/[id]/page.tsx`

**Issue**: Clicking "Save" did not persist job edits - only simulated API call.

**Fix Implemented**:

- **API Integration**: Implemented proper API call to `/jobs/${jobId}` endpoint
- **Form Validation**: Added validation for required fields
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **Modal Integration**: Added `JobActionModal` for success/error feedback

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Added imports
import JobActionModal, { ModalType } from "@/components/common/JobActionModal";
import { showNotification } from "@/utils/notificationUtils";
import { api } from "@/services/api";

// Added form validation
const requiredFields = ['title', 'company', 'location', 'salary', 'duration', 'description'];
const missingFields = requiredFields.filter(field => !formData[field as keyof Job]);

// Implemented API call
const response = await api.put(`/jobs/${jobId}`, formData);
```

### 3. Employer Portal - Shortlist Candidate Button

**Location**: 
- `frontend/src/app/employer_portal/workspace/candidates/page.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/virtualized/VirtualizedCandidateList.tsx`

**Issue**: Button did not update candidate status - only local state management.

**Fix Implemented**:

- **API Integration**: Implemented proper API call to `/candidates/${candidateId}/shortlist` endpoint
- **State Management**: Added shortlisted candidates state with localStorage persistence
- **Loading States**: Added loading states for individual candidate shortlisting
- **Visual Feedback**: Added Bookmark icon with filled/unfilled states
- **Toast Notifications**: Success and error notifications
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback

**Key Features**:
- Individual loading states per candidate
- Visual feedback with Bookmark icon
- API integration with POST request
- Local state persistence
- Toast notifications for immediate feedback
- Proper error handling

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Added state management
const [shortlistedCandidates, setShortlistedCandidates] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const [isShortlisting, setIsShortlisting] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Implemented API call
const response = await api.post(`/candidates/${candidateId}/shortlist`, {
  shortlisted: !isCurrentlyShortlisted
});

// Added visual feedback
<Bookmark className={`h-5 w-5 ${isShortlisted ? 'fill-blue-500 text-blue-500' : ''}`} />
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Integration Pattern

All fixes follow a consistent API integration pattern:

1. **Async/Await**: All API calls use async/await for proper error handling
2. **Try-Catch**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
3. **Loading States**: Proper loading states during API operations
4. **State Updates**: Optimistic updates with rollback on error
5. **User Feedback**: Toast notifications and modal feedback

### Modal Integration
